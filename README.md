0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

A project topic on sorting algorithms by Akunekwu Isabella
Our files print_array.c and print_list.c (containing the print_array and print_list functions) will be compiled with your functions during the correction.
Please declare the prototype of the functions print_array and print_list in your sort.h header file
Please use the following data structure for doubly linked list:

Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n square -> O(n^2)
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
n + k -> O(n+k)
…
Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

Tests
Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: Random.org

For Data Structures, Sorting is an important concept to help make sense of large datasets. This helps in performing lookup operations
